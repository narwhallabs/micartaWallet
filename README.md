# micartaWallet

This project includes DXFs, PDF for a paper template, a fusion archive, and a step archive to make your own micarta wallet, or a wallet out of any other thin, rigid, flat material. We recommend a silicone or rubber band with a 2" length flat, and 0.5" wide. Grocery store produce or lobster claw rubber bands are a good, free option.
